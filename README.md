> IPFS install manager

## Install

```console
$ npm i -g iim
```

Note: Windows not yet supported!

## Usage

**Example - Use the latest version of Kubo**

```sh
$ iim use kubo
âœ” selected kubo version 0.24.0
âœ” installed kubo 0.24.0
âœ” installed binary at /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs
âœ” initialized IPFS at /Users/alan/.iim/kubo@0.24.0
âœ” configured IPFS
âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs -> /Users/alan/.iim/dists/current
âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
ðŸš€ IPFS is ready to use

$ ipfs version
kubo version: 0.24.0
```

**Example - Use Kubo at version 0.23.0**

```sh
$ iim use kubo 0.23
âœ” selected kubo version 0.23.0
âœ” installed kubo 0.23.0
âœ” installed binary at /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs
âœ” initialized IPFS at /Users/alan/.iim/kubo@0.23.0
âœ” configured IPFS
âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs -> /Users/alan/.iim/dists/current
âœ” symlinked /Users/alan/.iim/dists/kubo@0.23.0/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
ðŸš€ IPFS is ready to use

$ ipfs version
kubo version: 0.23.0
```

## How does it work?

A new repo is created and used for each implementation/version combination at `~/.iim/kubo@0.24.0`, for example.

Adds a symlink at `/usr/local/bin/ipfs` that points to a script that runs IPFS with `IPFS_PATH` set to `~/.iim/kubo@0.24.0`.

IPFS is installed to `~/.iim/dists/kubo@0.24.0/node_modules/ipfs` or `~/.iim/dists/go-ipfs@0.4.18/node_modules/go-ipfs-dep` for example.

## Common issues

### Failed to symlink

Looks like this:

```sh
$ iim use kubo
âœ” selected kubo version 0.4.18
âœ” installed kubo 0.4.18
âœ” installed binary at /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs
âœ” initialized IPFS at /home/dave/.iim/kubo@0.4.18
âœ” symlinked /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs -> /home/dave/.iim/dists/current
âœ– failed to symlink /home/dave/.iim/dists/kubo@0.4.18/ipfs -> /usr/local/bin/ipfs
ðŸ’¥ failed to link binary at /usr/local/bin/ipfs, try running sudo iim link
```

Don't worry! Mostly everything worked fine - you just don't have permission to write to `/usr/local/bin`! Just run `sudo iim link` and it'll try again to create that symlink.
